          <h4>Experience</h4>
          <p>Claims Bureau USA has been in business since 1956 and has been providing clients with quality investigation since inception. We were one of the first insurance fraud investigation agencies servicing the insurance industry. 
          </p> 

          <h4>Creativity</h4>
          <p>Our company has always utilized a unique and creative approach to investigation. Our customized solutions have been proven to be successful and, as a result, we have become the preferred investigative vendor of choice for many of our clients.</p>

          <h4>Structure</h4>
          <p>Claims Bureau USA is structured like no other investigative company. We utilize our own company employees to conduct every investigation, which enables our clients to expect and to receive the highest quality product possible. </p> 
          <p>In addition, our specialized units allow our investigators to focus on their individual areas of expertise.</p> 
          <p>The structure of our organization allows Claims Bureau USA the ability to adjust to our clients' ever changing needs as well as the ability to accommodate any size job including large-scale rush assignments. </p> 

          <h4>Partnership</h4>
          <p>Our clients are provided with a dedicated account representative to act as a singular point of contact and to develop a strong relationship between the parties. One of the dedicated account representative’s most important responsibilities is to ingrain themselves in our clients’ operation to learn more about them. This valuable knowledge allows us to better serve our clients’ needs, strategize about their claims and investigations and meet, if not exceed, their expectations.   </p> 
          <p>Our company partners with our clients by providing fraud awareness and investigative training. Our staff routinely take part in roundtable discussions with our clients in order to develop creative cost-effective solutions. </p>

          <h4>Customer Service</h4>
          <p>Our superior customer service ethic is second to none in our industry. A client’s satisfaction is of the utmost importance to our company. Our industry leading customer service model coupled with our quality work product is what prompts clients to prefer Claims Bureau USA over any other investigative company.</p>
          <p>We have always measured our success by our unmatched client retention rate and customer satisfaction and we appreciate the fact that existing clients refer new clients to our company everyday. </p>
