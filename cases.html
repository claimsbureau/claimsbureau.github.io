    <h2>Increasing Savings</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <p>After meeting with a major insurance carrier, it was learned that the carrier was utilizing the services of multiple, national investigation vendors who all conducted business the same way. The carrier was spending millions of dollars on multi-day surveillance assignments and flat rate database research resulting in little return on investment.</p>
        <p>Claims Bureau USA assisted the carrier’s claim department by conducting investigative training and by promoting red flag awareness.  The carrier developed a team of experienced risk/claim analysts to analyze suspicious claims and to define specific items that warranted additional investigation.</p> 
        <p>The collaboration between Claims Bureau USA and the carrier resulted in their investigative dollars being spent in a targeted manner and often times uncovering information crucial to the claim. Investigative practices commonly used are a combination of desktop investigation, telephone inquiries and targeted surveillance. The carrier subsequently drove their reserve savings to investigative spending ratio to an eventual high of 60:1.</p>

    <h2>Reducing Cost</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <p>Another major insurance carrier, with whom Claims Bureau USA is now the preferred vendor, was also utilizing the services of a national investigations vendor. This carrier was spending millions of dollars on surveillance and flat rate database research assignments.  The claims department had limited resources and was missing opportunities and significant information that could have impacted claims, which would have resulted in savings.</p>
        <p>An investigative plan of action was developed between the carrier and Claims Bureau USA to ensure that the carrier would be provided with all information regarding a subject through a broad based background investigation. This approach was slightly more expensive per case than the flat rate database research model but resulted in uncovering more information, reduced investigative costs and has attributed to $40 million in reserve savings annually.</p>
